# Progress

## Phase 0: Capture spike (2026-10-30)

Status: acceptance passed on iPhone 15, iOS 27.2, as reported by Rupesh. Branch `phase-0-capture-spike`, not merged.

### What was built
- Empty Flutter app, iOS only, minimum iOS 17, bundle ID `com.rupeshkankrej.paisa`, signed with the free Personal Team.
- `ios/Runner/IngestBankMessageIntent.swift`: the App Intent, in the main app target, appends one JSON line to `inbox.jsonl` in App Group `group.com.rupeshkankrej.paisa`. It does not open the app.
- `lib/main.dart`: temporary screen showing the raw inbox, read over the `paisa/inbox` method channel in `AppDelegate.swift`. Replace it in Phase 1.
- `doc/` renamed to `docs/` to match CLAUDE.md and the spec.

### Automation that worked
Shortcuts → Automation → Message → Message Contains `HDFC Bank`, sender blank, Run Immediately → Ingest bank message, with the message as input.

The sender filter was not tried. A test SMS from another phone cannot come from `VM-HDFCBK`.

### Checks
- `flutter analyze`: no issues. `flutter test`: 2 passed.
- Swift `RunnerTests` (line format) passed on the iPhone.
- Rupesh confirmed on the device that the capture works ("yes it is working").

### What to verify on the device
Confirmed by Rupesh: real HDFC alerts for both money sent and money received trigger the automation and appear in the app, using the text filter. This covers real bank senders (SPEC 2.1 risk a).

Not separately confirmed:
- Whether those alerts were sorted into Transactions when they fired (SPEC 2.1 risk b).
- Whether it writes while the phone is locked. A message before the first unlock after a restart may fail, because of iOS file protection.

### Open issues and setup notes
- The free-team install expires after 7 days and the automation stops until it is re-run from Xcode. Next expiry is about 2026-11-06.
- Reinstalling with `flutter install` uninstalls first. iOS can then drop the developer trust, so redo Settings → General → VPN & Device Management → Trust.
- Use release builds. Debug builds will not launch from the home screen without a Mac attached.
- `xcodebuild test` on the device replaces the release build, so rebuild and reinstall afterwards.
- Homebrew's Flutter ships `gen_snapshot_arm64` with the macOS quarantine flag, and macOS kills it (exit -9). This was fixed by removing the flag from that one file with `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine`. A Flutter upgrade may bring it back, and 45 other Flutter files still carry the flag.
- No iOS simulator runtime is installed, so Swift tests run on the phone. Phase 1 acceptance needs a simulator, which can be added in Xcode → Settings → Components.
- The app name is still an open question in SPEC section 8. The bundle and App Group IDs use "paisa", so decide before Phase 1.
- The Phase 2 inbox reader must not lose lines appended while it reads and truncates `inbox.jsonl`.
